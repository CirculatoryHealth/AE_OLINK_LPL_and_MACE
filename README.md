### Abstract

**Introduction** Carotid plaque intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) is associated with future cardiovascular events. For this, we hypothesized that plasma proteins associated with carotid plaque IPH are also likely to be associated with Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

**Methods** In pre-operative blood samples from patients undergoing CEA within the Athero-Express biobank, we measured proteins involved in cardiovascular disease using three OLINK® proteomics immunoassays. We analyzed the association of proteins with IPH using logistic regression analyses. Subsequently, we analyzed the association of the IPH associated plasma proteins with the three-year postoperative risk of MACE (including stroke, myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death).

**Results** Within the three-year follow-up, 130 patients (18,9%) out of 688 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA developed MACE. We found that six out of 276 plasma proteins were significantly associated with IPH, from which only Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) was associated with the postoperative risk of MACE undergoing CEA. Within the 30-day perioperative period high plasma LPL was independently associated with an increased risk for MACE (adjusted HR per SD:1.60(1.10-2.30), p=0.014). From 30-days up and till 3-years, however, high LPL was associated with a lower risk for MACE (adjusted HR per SD:0.80(0.65-0.99), p=0.036).

**Conclusion** High LPL concentrations, were found to be associated with a higher risk for MACE in the first 30 postoperative days but associated with a lower risk MACE in the time period from 30 days up and till 3 years, meaning that LPL has different hazards at different time points.

### Reproducibility

This project uses the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS) to
ensure transparency and reproducibility. The workflow is designed to meet the
principles of Open Science throughout a research project. 

To learn how WORCS helps researchers meet the TOP-guidelines and FAIR principles,
read the preprint at https://osf.io/zcvbs/

#### WORCS: Advice for authors

### Data availability

The data used in this project are available through a [DataverseNL repository](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/S8PXOJ "Replication Data for: Plasma Lipoprotein Lipase is associated with Risk for Future Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients Following Carotid Endarterectomy"). The data are sensitive since they involve personal information of patients. There are also restrictions on use by commercial parties, and on sharing openly based on (inter)national laws and regulations and the written informed consent. Therefore these data (and additional clinical data) are only available upon discussion and signing a Data Sharing Agreement (see Terms of Access) and within a specially designed UMC Utrecht provided environment.

Plaque samples are derived from arterial endarterectomies as part of the [Athero-Express Biobank Study](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10564-004-2304-6) which is an ongoing study in the UMC Utrecht. We would like to thank all the (former) employees involved in the Athero-Express Biobank Study of the Departments of Surgery of the St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein and University Medical Center Utrecht for their continuing work. In particular we would like to thank (in no particular order) Marijke Linschoten, Arjan Samani, Petra H. Homoed-van der Kraak, Tim Bezemer, Tim van de Kerkhof, Joyce Vrijenhoek, Evelyn Velema, Ben van Middelaar, Sander Reukema, Robin Reijers, Joëlle van Bennekom, and Bas Nelissen. Lastly, we would like to thank all participants of the Athero-Express Biobank Study; without you these studies would not be possible.
